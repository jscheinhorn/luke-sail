                <p>Each boat can determine which option suits them best and how meal tasks will be assigned throughout the week or if breakfasts and lunches will be done on an individual basis.</p>
                <p>Groceries exist on most Islands:

            <div class="faq-question">Is it possible to sail on another boat?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>It is possible to rotate during sails as long as each boat has enough experienced crew for their skipper to sail. Please check with your skipper(s).</p>

          <div class="faq-question">Why a catamaran?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>They have two hulls and don't roll as much as a monohull. Comfort and spaciousness.</p>

          <div class="faq-question">What's a dinghy?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>We ride the dinghy to and from the shore.</p>
            <p>It's a smallish, semi-rigid boat with an outboard motor that we put into the water to get the rest of the way to land when the catamaran is moored / at anchor.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Most of the time.</p>
                <p>Can buy a prepaid SIM card for $25-50 EC to put in your phone if you don’t have a global plan. 
                    There is lots of WiFi on islands, including at bars and restaurants. Good to use WhatsApp for WiFi calling and messaging.

            <div class="faq-question">Local etiquette / expectations</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <h4>Clothing / Nudity</h4>
                <p>Away from the beach and at any town, bar, restaurant, etc. etiquette is to wear a shirt and shorts/skirt, etc., not beachwear. Toplessness is illegal on most Islands.</p>
              <h4>Tipping</h4>
                <p>10% is standard if a service charge is not already included in the bill. It’s not always expected.
                </p>
             <h4>Taxis</h4>
                <p>Set the price before getting in. Make sure you’re talking the same currency, EC or US</p>
                <h4>Drugs</h4>
            <p>Marijuana legal on St Vincent - thanks to the rastas! medical licenses available at coconut grove beach club in blue lagoon and at plantation house in bequia. Keep it to less than an ounce for good measure. Other drug laws are very strict and include imprisonment.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">What safety equipment is there?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Life raft, EPIRB, VHF Radios, life vests, flares. We will have a safety briefing on the first day to go over the safety equipment on the boat and any protocols, including day-to-day practices for safe use of the gas stoves, closing hatches, etc.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">Bugs and natural dangers?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Stripy legged mosquitoes can carry disease although being on the water you’re much less likely to encounter them. They breed more in rainy months. Bug spray and mosquito coils can help keep them and other bugs at bay, especially around sunset.</p> 
                <p>Scorpions and centipedes are poisonous but not deadly and are rare.</p>
                <p>Manchineel trees have toxic yellow-green apples and its leaves can give you a poison ivy-like rash. They’re good to stand under for shade, but not in the rain. On beaches you’ll sometimes find them identified with signs.

                <p>Sea urchins can hurt your feet in the water.</p> 
                <p>Be aware of boats in the area when swimming and snorkeling.</p>
                <p>No known shark attacks are on record in the Windward Islands. You might see a nurse shark. These are generally harmless unless provoked.</p>
                <p>Don’t touch coral.</p>
                <p>Sea ants can cause some tingling and jellyfish can sting. A little vinegar soak helps for stings.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">Do I need a certification to scuba dive?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Many dive shops will give you a short PADI primer course to train you and will guide you to limited depths (~40ft) if you do not have a certification but still want to dive</p>
            </div>
        </div>
         <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Do I need to know how to sail? Will I sail the boat?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The boats are arranged so that there is a sufficient number of trained skippers, experienced crew, and crew on each boat. Skippers have either RYA Day Skipper or ASA Bareboat certification or equivalent experience. There are plenty of sailing duties to help with for willing and able crew, including hoistng and dousing sails, dropping anchor, picking up moorings, being a lookout. These skills can be conferred to you by your skippers/experienced crew. Let your skipper know if you'd like to have a hand on the helm!</p>
